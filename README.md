# Personal Exercises Solution Set

## Brief Introduction

This is my personal exercise solution repository. It contains my thoughts on some of the problems I encountered during the learning process, organized in units of books (i.e. folders named after book names). For some difficult problems, I may present my solutions in a verbose manner to enhance their intuitiveness.

I am making this repository public because I hope my thinking can help others who are learning the same content. I will do my best to ensure that my answers are correct. However, if you need to refer to these answers, please do not blindly believe them.

## Usage

All exercise solutions were initially written using Markdown files and Typora was used as the editing tool. So I recommend that you download these files locally and open them using Typora for a better reading experience. At the same time, try to avoid using Github's preview function directly for online viewing, as many formulas and layouts cannot be displayed properly.

In addition, during special stages (such as when the answers to a chapter of a book have already been edited, or when the answers to the entire book have been edited), I will export the markdown content in HTML and PDF formats for direct download.
